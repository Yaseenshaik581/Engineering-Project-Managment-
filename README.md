Because engineering projects are usually complicated, costly, and high-risk, the field of engineering project management is in great demand among employers and necessitates a solid understanding of skills that are not covered in an engineer's undergraduate education. Effective management of engineering projects is ultimately about influencing people at all levels and ensuring that each work stream is executed to specification, finished on time, is within budget, and fulfills any legal or regulatory requirements. The current cafeteria faces challenges like overcrowding and long wait times due to limited space, affecting students, staff, and visitors. To resolve these issues, APUâ€™s Property Development Department has initiated a project to build a modern facility that can comfortably accommodate up to 250 people. The project aims to provide a more spacious, comfortable, and efficient dining environment while ensuring sustainability, safety, and compliance with modern standards. This report details the project scope, work breakdown structure, cost estimates, and scheduling, outlining the steps necessary to complete the cafeteria by the end of 2024.
